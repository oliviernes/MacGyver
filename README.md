## Presentation:

MacGyver is trapped inside a labyrinth where the exit is guard by a
 watchman. His only way to escape is to put the warden to sleep jabbing
 him with a syringe full of ether. To make the syringe, he will
 have to recover a tube, a needle and an ether flask scattered in the 
 maze. Those 3 items are scattered ramdomly at each new game. If 
 MacGyver is dumb enough to reach the guard without a syringe, he dies
 pitifully...
